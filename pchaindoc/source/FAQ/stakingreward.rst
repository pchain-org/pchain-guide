Staking Reward
=====================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. How many total pos mining reward and what’s the distribution plan ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PCHAIN total pos mining reward is 315,000,000 PI.
::
 Distribution:
 Year1~Year4 : 39,375,000 PI per year
 Year5～Year8：19,687,500 PI per year
 Year9～Year12:9,843,750 PI per year
 Year13～Year16:4,921,875 PI per year
 Year17～Year20：2,460,937.5 PI per year
 Year21～Year24: 2,460,937. PI per year

2. How can I get staking reward?
-------------------------------------------------------------
You need to vote for the validator. If succeed, then you can get reward in next epoch. 
If you are the nun-tech people, you can delegate token to candidate. Once the candidate you delegated to vote for the validator successfully, then you can share the reward as well in next epoch.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. I have delegated to one candidate for over 25 days, why haven’t I received any reward?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you delegated in current epoch, you can get reward when new epoch starts once the candidate vote for the next epoch validator successfully. 
If you delegated in last epoch, it means the candidate failed in voting for the validator. So you won’t get rewards.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. When will the reward unlock?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reward you received in each epoch will be unlocked automatically in 12 epochs. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. How many reward that I may receive in one epoch?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PoS mining reward depends on your PI amount percentage of total staking amount in each epoch. 
PoS mining reward ≈ Your staking amount/ total staking amount * block reward * the number of epoch blocks
If you are the delegator, then your reward ≈ (1- commission fee(%) ) * Your staking amount/ total staking amount * block reward * the number of epoch blocks

| ** commission fee will be released to the candidate.**
